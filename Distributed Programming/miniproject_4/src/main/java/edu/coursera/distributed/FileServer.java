       * of the HTTP message on that socket and returning of the requested
       * file in a separate thread. You are free to choose how that new
       * thread is created. Common approaches would include spawning a new
       * Java Thread or using a Java Thread Pool. The steps to complete
       * the handling of HTTP messages are the same as in MiniProject 2,
       * but are repeated below for convenience:
       *
       *   a) Using Socket.getInputStream(), parse the received HTTP
       *      packet. In particular, we are interested in confirming this
       *      message is a GET and parsing out the path to the file we are
       *      GETing. Recall that for GET HTTP packets, the first line of
       *      the received packet will look something like:
       *
       *          GET /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
       *   b) Using the parsed path to the target file, construct an
       *      HTTP reply and write it to Socket.getOutputStream(). If the
       *      file exists, the HTTP reply should be formatted as follows:
       *
       *        HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n
       *        Server: FileServer\r\n
       *        \r\n
       *        FILE CONTENTS HERE\r\n
       *
       *      If the specified file does not exist, you should return a
       *      reply with an error code 404 Not Found. This reply should be
       *      formatted as:
       *
       *        HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found\r\n
       *        Server: FileServer\r\n
       *        \r\n
       *
       * If you wish to do so, you are free to re-use code from
       * MiniProject 2 to help with completing this MiniProject.
